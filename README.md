This project is meant to demonstrate an understanding of the fundamentals of CSS Grid. The goal of this project is to create a dashboard-like layout that was assigned to me from the Odin Project Intermediate HTML and CSS course in the FUll Stack JavaScript Path. The initial layout that I will be modeling my project after is in the img folder withing my repo and is titled dashboard-project-img.png.
